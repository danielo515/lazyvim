# ðŸ’¤ LazyVim

My personal configuration for [LazyVim](https://github.com/LazyVim/LazyVim).
Clone it into `~/.config/Lazy`. Why? Because I have a command setup to open neovim like this:

```shell
lzvim(){
  NVIM_APPNAME=Lazy nvim "$@"
}
```

Refer to the [documentation](https://lazyvim.github.io/installation) to get started.
